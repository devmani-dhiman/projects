This is a spam classifier using SVM algorithm.
This projects demonstrate the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the field of Machine learning and Artifical Intelligence.
The main aim of this project is to get familiar with NLP.
First the messages are converted to vectors using CountVectorizer() library and then this preprocessed data is feeded into the algorithm.
