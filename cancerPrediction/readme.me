The ID field contains the patient identifiers. The characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.

The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4).
